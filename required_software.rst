Required Software
=================

The first time we did this course, it was lame b/c students had to install a bunch of stuff.  They need:

 - Cygwin
   - with the required openshift packages
   - with the rhc tools
 - tortoisegit
 - python
 - virtualenv
 - git bash
 - nodejs
 - npm
 - coffee-script
