Tools for teaching the open source projects seminar @ RIT
=========================================================

This is an all-purpose repository for storing some content, but mostly tools for
teaching the open source projects seminar @ RIT.

Future tools could include things like scripts to produce blog/commit/unittest
statistics.  This is also a place the syllabus could live, where students could
fork and produce pull requests.
