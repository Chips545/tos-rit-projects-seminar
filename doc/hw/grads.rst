Grad Student Responsibilities
=============================

Students registered for this course's graduate section will be responsible for
two or more of the following deliverables as part of their evaluation in this
course:

#. Storytelling
    In addition to regular coursework, graduate students may write (2) or
    more major articles related to the course and it's activities over the
    course of the quarter. These posts will be no less than 500 words, and
    will preferably be posted on other upstream websites.
#. Hackathons
    Graduate students must not only attend, but also co-organize at least
    (2) hackathons per quarter. Hackathons will be at least 8 hours in
    length, and will be open to students, and encourage community members
    to attend.
#. Course Support
    Over the duration of the quarter, graduate students may contribute
    useful tools, scripts, utilities, or other programs and applications
    that assist the professor in gathering data, metrics, and insight about
    the students and their course related activities. These tools, like all
    code developed in this course, must be released under an OSI approved
    license.
#. Office Hours
    In addition to class time, Graduate Students may hold office hours or
    study sessions for students to work together and ask questions. Grad
    students will make themselves available during these designated times.
    Optionally, the professor may conduct office hours in conjunction with,
    or complementary to, graduate student hours.
