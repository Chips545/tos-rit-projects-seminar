Homework - Rubric
=================

An excerpt from :doc:`../syllabus`:

  An `open` course -- students will have access to the 'document source' for the
  syllabus and grading rubric.  While you are reading `the syllabus` right now,
  as a student of the class you have a right to `fork the upstream repository
  <http://github.com/ralphbean/tos-rit-projects-seminar>`_, make modifications,
  and submit patches for review.  Barring a troll festival, this can create a fun,
  dynamic environment in which the course curriculum can develop by the very same
  mechanism being taught during the quarter (community-driven).
  
  A `fun` course -- while the primary deliverable for the course is a working
  web-based game, we are going to subject the course itself to `gamification`.
  Instead of grading students' final projects individually, projects will be
  pitted against one another through a scheme developed by the students
  themselves, called the :doc:`../final_project_rubric`.

Part of the experience of being an open source developer is the `instrinsic motivation` that drives you to build open software.  That motivation can be different for each person.  Its not something that is ever taught and is difficult to develop into a course curriculum for sure!

Your assignment here is to take part in creating :doc:`../final_project_rubric`.  You must
fork the github repo of the course content, commit patches to the document, push
to your github repo and issue pull requests.

Although open source development is typically thought of as a `cooperative` mode of production, some participants derive their motivation from a competitive outlook towards their peer developers.  As an experiment, you will all be graded in competition with one another for this assignment.

 - There are 100 possible points.
 - The student with the highest `impact` will receive 100 points.
 - All other students who contribute patches will receive a `weighted` grade
   between 100 and 75 points based on their `impact`.
 - Students who submit no patches will receive 0 points.

Your `impact` is defined as the number of lines added + the number of lines deleted.
You can see a graph of your `impact` so far
`here <https://github.com/ralphbean/tos-rit-projects-seminar/graphs/impact>`_.

Good luck!  And make an awesome `rubric` worthy of awesome projects!
