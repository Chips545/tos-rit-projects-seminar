Grad Students - Extra Responsibilities
======================================

This is a skeleton of ideas for extra duties of the grad students of the class.

Office Hours
------------

One idea was to hold 'office hours' in the FOSSBox at certain hours to help other students with the details of open source and git.

Commarch
--------

A detailed commarch assignment, either with something we're familiar with or a paricular success/failure story in open source would help other students understand the good and bad practices of open source development.

Problem: adds work but doesn't do much for the grad students.
