Grad Students - Extra Responsibilities
======================================

This is a skeleton of ideas for extra duties of the grad students of the class.

Office Hours
------------

One idea was to hold 'office hours' in the FOSSBox at certain hours to help
other students with the details of open source and git.


Commarch
--------

A detailed commarch assignment, either with something we're familiar with or a
paricular success/failure story in open source would help other students
understand the good and bad practices of open source development.

Problem: adds work but doesn't do much for the grad students.

Storytelling
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also falls under the Commarch category, but in a more structured manner:

    - Provide periodic blog posts, possibly bi-weekly
    - Correspond with course milestones
      (e.g. Project team formation, initial brainstorming of ideas,
       play-testing phase, final releases, etc...)
    - Highlight particularly interesting/representative stories from
      student teams or student blog posts.

Quarterly Hackathons
--------------------

Strategically placed hackathons will help students to complete their projects.
Proposed dates would be:
    - Week 3 before we leave for winter break
    - Week 8 before finals week(s) get too crazy
    - Week 11 right before final projects are due
